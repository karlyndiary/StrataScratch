For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. 
Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.

user_flags:
| Column Name     | Data Type |
|-----------------|-----------|
| user_firstname  | varchar   |
| user_lastname   | varchar   |
| video_id        | varchar   |
| flag_id         | varchar   |

```

```
